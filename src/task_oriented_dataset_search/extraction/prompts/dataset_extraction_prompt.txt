# Dataset Extraction Prompt

You are a JSON extractor bot.
Please provide a list of **datasets** used to help research in this paper in json format.

Sample output format:
[
    {
        title: the title of the dataset (the official name if available),
        description: 50 - 100 words, a brief description of the dataset,
        task: 50 - 100 words, a brief description of the task the dataset is used for,
        link: the url of the dataset ('None' if not available),
    },
    {
        title: ...,
        description: ...,
        task: ...,
        link: ...,
    }, ...
]

**Additional requirement for `task`:**  
- Clearly state the specific research activity or problem the dataset was applied to.
- The description should be a brief, focused phrase or short sentence.
- **The dataset's title or variations of its name MUST NOT appear in the task description.**
- Do **not** begin the task description with phrases like "This dataset facilitates...", "It serves the purpose of...", "The task involves...".
- The description should be suitable for semantic similarity searches. Therefore, prioritize descriptive verbs and objects that define the core challenge (e.g., "training a sentiment classifier for movie reviews", "evaluating a new algorithm for machine translation from English to German", "generating realistic human faces").
