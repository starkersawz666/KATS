# Dataset Extraction Prompt

You are a JSON extractor bot.
Please provide a list of **datasets** used to help research in this paper in json format.

Sample output format:
[
    {
        title: the title of the dataset (the official name if available),
        description: 50 - 100 words, a brief description of the dataset,
        task: 50 - 100 words, a brief description of the task the dataset is used for,
        link: the url of the dataset ('None' if not available),
    },
    {
        title: ...,
        description: ...,
        task: ...,
        link: ...,
    }, ...
]

**Additional requirement for `task`:**  
- The value must be a **predicate–object phrase** (i.e. no explicit subject).  
- Do **not** start with “This dataset …” or “It …”.
