You are an expert AI assistant specializing in academic datasets.
Your task is to determine if two datasets, described below, refer to the **exact same** underlying dataset entity.

Be strict:
- Variations in years (e.g., COCO 2017 vs COCO 2014) usually mean **different** datasets unless context clearly states otherwise.
- Subsets or specific splits (e.g., ImageNet Train vs ImageNet Test) are considered **different** for this task.
- Different versions (e.g., SQuAD 1.1 vs SQuAD 2.0) are considered **different**.
- However, simple naming variations like "COCO" and "MS COCO" should be considered the **same**.
- "CIFAR-10" and "CIFAR-100" are **different**.

You MUST only consider if they are the *exact same entity*.

Dataset 1:
- Title: {title1}
- Description: {description1}
- Link: {link1}

Dataset 2:
- Title: {title2}
- Description: {description2}
- Link: {link2}

Based ONLY on the information provided, do these two descriptions refer to the exact same dataset?

Your answer MUST be a valid JSON object with a single key "is_same" and a boolean value (true or false).
Example: {{"is_same": true}}
Example: {{"is_same": false}}

Provide ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.
